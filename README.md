# Jaya Jaya Institut - Student Dropout Prediction Project

## Business Understanding

Jaya Jaya Institut is an educational institution established in 2000 that has produced many graduates with excellent reputations. However, the institution faces a significant challenge with students who do not complete their education (dropouts). The high dropout rate poses a major problem for any educational institution, as it affects both the institution's reputation and the students' future prospects.

To address this challenge, Jaya Jaya Institut aims to detect students who are likely to dropout as early as possible, enabling them to provide targeted guidance and support to prevent student attrition.

## Business Problems

This project addresses three critical business questions:

### 1. What are the key factors that contribute to student dropout rates?
Understanding the primary indicators and risk factors that lead to student dropout will help the institution identify at-risk students early.

### 2. Can we accurately predict which students are likely to dropout?
Developing a reliable predictive model to identify students at risk of dropping out before it happens, allowing for proactive intervention.

### 3. How can we monitor and track student performance effectively?
Creating a comprehensive monitoring system that provides real-time insights into student performance and dropout risk patterns.
